### 1. **Difference between 'Pass by Value' and 'Pass by Reference'**

- **Pass by Value**: A copy of the actual value is passed. Changes made to the parameter inside the function have no effect on the actual value.
    
    ```jsx
    let a = 5;
    function changeValue(val) {
        val = 10;
    }
    changeValue(a);
    console.log(a); // Output: 5
    
    ```
    
- **Pass by Reference**: A reference to the actual value is passed. Changes made to the parameter affect the actual value.
    
    ```jsx
    let obj = { x: 5 };
    function changeValue(ref) {
        ref.x = 10;
    }
    changeValue(obj);
    console.log(obj.x); // Output: 10
    
    ```
    

### 2. **Difference between `map` and `filter`**

- **`map`**: Creates a new array by applying a function to each element of the array.
    
    ```jsx
    const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
    const doubled = numbers.map(n => n * 2);
    console.log(doubled); // Output: [2, 4, 6, 8]
    
    ```
    
- **`filter`**: Creates a new array containing only elements that pass a certain condition.
    
    ```jsx
    const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
    const evens = numbers.filter(n => n % 2 === 0);
    console.log(evens); // Output: [2, 4]
    
    ```
    

### 3. **Difference between `map()` and `forEach()`**

- **`map()`**: Returns a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the array.
    
    ```jsx
    const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
    const squared = numbers.map(n => n * n);
    console.log(squared); // Output: [1, 4, 9]
    
    ```
    
- **`forEach()`**: Executes a provided function once for each array element, but doesnâ€™t return anything.
    
    ```jsx
    const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
    numbers.forEach(n => console.log(n * n));
    // Output: 1, 4, 9 (but returns undefined)
    
    ```
    

### 4. **Difference between Pure and Impure Functions**

- **Pure Function**: Given the same inputs, always returns the same output and has no side effects.
    
    ```jsx
    function pure(a, b) {
        return a + b;
    }
    
    ```
    
- **Impure Function**: May have side effects or return different outputs for the same inputs.
    
    ```jsx
    let x = 10;
    function impure(a) {
        return a + x; // Depends on an external variable
    }
    
    ```
    

### 5. **Difference between `for-in` and `for-of`**

    for (let key in obj) {
        console.log(key); // Output: 'a', 'b', 'c'
    }
    
    ```
    
- **`for-of`**: Iterates over the values of an iterable object (like arrays, strings).
    
    ```jsx
    let arr = [10, 20, 30];
    for (let value of arr) {
        console.log(value); // Output: 10, 20, 30
    }
    
    ```
    

### 6. **Differences between `call()`, `apply()`, and `bind()`**

        console.log(greeting + ', ' + this.name);
    }
    const person = { name: 'John' };
    greet.call(person, 'Hello'); // Output: Hello, John
    
    ```
    
- **`apply()`**: Similar to `call()`, but arguments are provided as an array.
    
    ```jsx
    greet.apply(person, ['Hi']); // Output: Hi, John
    
    ```
    
- **`bind()`**: Returns a new function with a specific `this` value and optional arguments.
    
    ```jsx
    const greetPerson = greet.bind(person, 'Hey');
    greetPerson(); // Output: Hey, John
    
    ```

    ```
    

---

A **Promise** in JavaScript is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. It acts as a placeholder for a future value that we don't yet have but expect to receive at some point. Promises help in managing asynchronous code by providing more readable and maintainable ways to handle success, failure, or any other state that an async operation might enter.

### Why Promises Are Needed

Before promises, JavaScript relied heavily on **callbacks** to handle asynchronous tasks, such as network requests or reading files. Callbacks had limitations, including:

- **Callback Hell**: When multiple asynchronous operations were nested inside one another, the code became deeply indented and hard to read and maintain.
- **Error Handling**: Managing errors across multiple asynchronous steps was complex and often inconsistent.
- **Inversion of Control**: When passing a callback function, control over when and how that function executes is lost.

Promises solve these issues by allowing:

- **Chaining**: Promises can be chained, making asynchronous code more linear and easier to read.
- **Better Error Handling**: Errors can be caught in a single `.catch()` block at the end of a promise chain, instead of dealing with multiple error callbacks.

### Key Differences Between Promises and Callbacks

| Aspect | Callbacks | Promises |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Readability | Leads to "callback hell" in nested async operations | More readable, especially with chaining |
| Error Handling | Each callback must handle its own errors | Errors propagate and can be caught in one place |
| Control Flow | Inversion of control, as we rely on the callback owner to invoke it | Developer retains control over the promise |
| Composition | Hard to compose multiple async tasks | Easier to compose with `.then()` and `.catch()` chaining |

### Types of Promises and Their Use Cases

1. **Basic Promise (Pending, Fulfilled, Rejected)**
    - **Description**: A promise starts in a `pending` state, then transitions to `fulfilled` (resolved) if the operation completes successfully, or to `rejected` if it fails.
    - **Use Case**: Used for handling any single asynchronous operation, such as fetching data from an API.
    - **Example**:
        
        ```jsx
        let promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
          setTimeout(() => resolve("Success!"), 1000);
        });
        promise.then((result) => console.log(result)); // Output after 1s: Success!
        
        ```
        
2. **Promise.all()**
    - **Description**: Takes an array of promises and returns a new promise that resolves when all of the input promises resolve or rejects if any promise rejects.
    - **Use Case**: When you want to run multiple asynchronous operations in parallel and proceed only after all of them have completed.
    - **Example**:
        
        ```jsx
        let promise1 = Promise.resolve(3);
        let promise2 = new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 100, "foo"));
        Promise.all([promise1, promise2]).then((values) => console.log(values)); // Output: [3, "foo"]
        
        ```
        
3. **Promise.race()**
    - **Description**: Takes an array of promises and returns a new promise that resolves or rejects as soon as one of the input promises resolves or rejects.
    - **Use Case**: Useful when you want the result of the fastest promise, like making multiple API calls to different endpoints and using whichever responds first.
    - **Example**:
        
        ```jsx
        let promise1 = new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 500, "First"));
        let promise2 = new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 100, "Second"));
        Promise.race([promise1, promise2]).then((value) => console.log(value)); // Output: "Second"
        
        ```
        
4. **Promise.allSettled()**
    - **Description**: Takes an array of promises and returns a new promise that resolves once all input promises have settled, regardless of whether they resolved or rejected.
    - **Use Case**: Useful when you want the results of all promises, but don't want a single rejection to short-circuit the operation.
    - **Example**:
        
        ```jsx
        let promise1 = Promise.resolve(3);
        let promise2 = Promise.reject("Error occurred");
        let promise3 = new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 100, "Done"));
        
        Promise.allSettled([promise1, promise2, promise3]).then((results) => {
          results.forEach((result) => console.log(result));
        });
        // Output:
        // {status: "fulfilled", value: 3}
        // {status: "rejected", reason: "Error occurred"}
        // {status: "fulfilled", value: "Done"}
        
        ```
        
5. **Promise.any()**
    - **Description**: Takes an array of promises and returns a new promise that resolves as soon as any of the input promises resolves. If all of the input promises reject, it rejects with an `AggregateError`.
    - **Use Case**: When you want any successful outcome from a set of promises and can ignore rejections, useful for scenarios like fallback mechanisms.
    - **Example**:
        
        ```jsx
        let promise1 = Promise.reject("Failed");
        let promise2 = new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 200, "First Success"));
        let promise3 = new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 100, "Second Success"));
        
        Promise.any([promise1, promise2, promise3]).then((value) => console.log(value)); // Output: "Second Success"
        
        ```
        

### Summary

Promises provide a cleaner, more manageable way to handle asynchronous operations, avoiding the nested structure of callbacks and enabling better error handling and control flow.
